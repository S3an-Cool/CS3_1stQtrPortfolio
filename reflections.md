# Topics I know very well:

1. Conditional Statements (if-else) [if]
If statements are used in decision-making code. It checks a condition and if it is true, it runs the code that is written inside of it. If the condition is false, or it returns a 0 value, you can write else{} after the first ‘if’ block, and it will run the block of code in the brackets. If statements are written in the syntax; if (condition to be checked) { code to be executed if true } else { code to be executed if false }.

2. Relational Operators
 Relational operators are operators that compare two values (a, b) and return either true or false, or, 1 or 0. They come in many forms such as <, >, ==, and many more. They are essential when using If statements as they are used as conditions. For example in an if statement; if (1 < 5) {console.log(1+5)}, this would return 6 since 1 is less than

 5. Logical Operators
Logical Operators are operators that either negate a condition or combine two or more conditions and return either true or false. && means AND, I I means OR, and ! means NOT. You use them like writing a sentence; (1 > 5) &&(AND) (5 > 1) would return false since only one condition is true. Whereas if you use I I (OR) in the same statement, you will get true, since only one needs to be true. ! Negates a condition, meaning it reverses true to false and false to true.


4. Variable declaration
Variable names are very specific and shouldn't be misspelled. Variable declaration is declaring that a variable is in the code and its value. You can do it using three keywords; var, let, and const. Var simply creates a variable that can change value. Let is similar, but it is confined to a specific scope in the code. Declaring a variable with const on the other hand makes it so that it cannot be changed by just reassigning it to another value.

5. Arithmetic operators
Arithmetic Operators are operators that  perform arithmetic operations on variables or constant numbers. They are similar to what you would normally use for math such as + and -. There are special operators that return different or unique values such as % which gives the remainder of a number if directly divided by another.


# Topics I know well but needs further discussion 
1. Number Objects
I just find the syntax of declaring a number to be difficult to apply, especially when pulling from HTML to a js script. I also don't understand parseInt() and parseFloat() fully.
2. Loop Control Structures (while, do… while, for… in)
I do actually find the execution and interpretation of these loops to be simple and easy to understand. I just find loops in quick succession like two while or two for loops in a function or statement to be confusing to interpret. I find that trying to read which loop will start and stop first to be difficult.
3. Loop Control Structures (break, continue, Nested Loop)
While I do understand and can use break and continue, I don't have an understanding of how Nested Loops work. Whenever I try to utilize them, I create infinite loops or errors.
4. Declaring Functions (as expressions)
I understand how to create functions as a declaration but I struggle to declare functions as expressions and when I'm supposed to use that method over functions as declarations. 
5. Processing Function Output
I am still confused about how the ‘return’ command works and which variable I should specify when running it.

To help myself understand and overcome my difficulties in these topics, I will read into them carefully until I fully understand the concepts. I will then practice using the different functions, statements, operators, etc. That I struggle with. I will also reread and review my quizzes and Long Tests, learning from the mistakes I made.

## Activities that were effective
I found the 1st Grades Activity to be effective because it uses a real world example to illustrate Input and Output, and the use of arithmetic operators. It was also very informative about .toFixed() which is useful.
I found the 2nd Graded Activity to be useful because it gives us good practice in the use of if, else if, and else statements in a fun and easy to understand way, with the use of the Higher or Lower game.

## Activities that were not effective 
I found the 6th Graded Exercise to be not effective because while it shows how to use loops effectively, the process or code to get the number series is confusing and complicated to beginners, going away from learning about loops.
I found the 7th Graded Exercise to be not effective because it just feeds us code that is made to solve a complex problem. It doesn't allow us to engage with the use of functions and just forces us to find hard to spot errors in a problem we don't understand.
